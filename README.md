# Fluid Typography Calculator

- [] Assess differences between mobile and desktop designs and list how best to structure HTML to deal with potential problems below:
    - The page header "fluid Typographay" has a line extending from the right that lengths as the screen width enlarges and the header's right margin increases.
    - There is also a line flowing vertically down from the header that lengthens as the screen width enlarges.
        - I will try building these first using margin borders. 
    - The calculator field sections have a vertical line between each that will extend slighter as the screen width enlarges.
- [] Structure HTML (with accessibility in mind)
- [] Apply BEM naming
